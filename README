I18nRouting
===========

i18n_routing is a rails plugin created to automatically use translated routes for your rails project.

For examples :
in english you will have : /users
And in french : /utilisateurs

This two resources, are juste declared once in your routes.rb and the good one is automatically selected when you use users_path depending on the I18n.locale
The translation is done simply by using I18n.t on your route name. translations are scoped : named_route / resource / resources

NO translations are made during runtime, all is precompiled when building routes at startup.

Works with : named_route (Rails 2) or any match (Rails 3), resource and resources

Gem needed: i18n with any backend

Warning: Rails 2.3 version is old and dirty, need clean up and intensive refactoring.

Installation :
==============

In your rails plugins folder : 
git clone git@github.com:kwi/i18n_routing.git

Usage in your routes.rb
=======================

For Rails 3 :

Simply declare a localized block with :

localized(I18n.available_locales, :verbose => true) do
  match 'about' => 'contents#about', :as  => :about

  resources :users
  resource  :forgot_my_password
end

For each locales you pass to localized, the i18n_routing plugin will try to translate the route.


For Rails 2.3.x :

map.with_options :globalized => true do |m|
  m.about, 'about', {:controller => 'contents', :action => :about})

  m.resources :users
  m.resource  :forgot_my_password
end

Automatically try to translate routes with each locales in I18n.available_locales

Tested with rails 2.3.5 and Rails 3 beta


TODO
====

  * Clean up and refactor Rails 2 version
  * Testing
  * Bug fix ?
